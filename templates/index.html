<h2>Hi!</h2>

<section>
    <p>
        I'm Hassan. I build ML models for the energy sector and usually go by the handle <mark class="highlight-handle">@hssn20</mark> or <mark class="highlight-handle">@hssn.io</mark> on the web. In my free time, I love to read (mostly on economics, evolution and cosmology) and workout.  Hopefully over the next few months I plan to start writing, so tag along/bookmark if you like mediocre blogs from men who have no idea what they're talking about.
