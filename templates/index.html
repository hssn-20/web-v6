<h2>Hi</h2>

    <p>
        I'm Hassan.I build recommender systems for the energy sector and usually go by the handle <mark class="highlight-handle">@hssn20</mark> or <mark class="highlight-handle">@hssn.io</mark> on the
        web. In my free time, I love to read (mostly on economics, evolution and cosmology)  and workout, sometimes both! Hopefully over the next few months I plan to get back into writing, so come along.
