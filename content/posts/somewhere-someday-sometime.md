**** Incomplete post****

The economy has been described as “an instituted process of interaction between man and his environment, which results in a continuous supply of want-satisfying material means”. In laymen terms, it's how a society provisions its members. Provisions in this case mean anything a society deems necessary for an individual to survive.

But wait, does that mean poverty is a political choice? Undoubtedly, yes. To take the example of the UK, during the 1970s and 1980s, a conscious restructuring of the economy was pursued by the goverment to increase inequality (and therefore poverty) levels. This was done to bring inflation under control without effecting the consumption levels of the upper classes, and it worked.

To illustrate this arbitrary nature of poverty, I’d like to narrate the story of two households, two cities and two countries. 

## A Home

Harpurhey, Manchester. Considered one of the most deprived areas in the UK, until the industrial revolution it was  quiet the opposite. A pleasant leafy suburb of Manchester with grand swimming pools, old churchs and new buildings.
