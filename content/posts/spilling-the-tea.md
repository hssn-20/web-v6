This is going to be a quick post. There's currrently some [drama](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/discussion/246772) in one of the kaggle competitions. It looks like the [organisers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/discussion/246782) didn't properly prepare the test set, resulting in a [label leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/leak-submission-lb-0-991). As I stated in my previous [post](https://www.hssn2.com/posts/dataworld-episode-1/), data processing is key. Mistakes will happen, evan at the best data companies. The important thing is to be open and document all steps of a process.
